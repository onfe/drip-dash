DripDash is an all-in-one aquaponics monitoring, control and data logging tool,
built with Vue on Node.js.

## :memo: About DripDash

Aquaponics is hard. It's a three-way ecosystem with plants, bacteria and fish
living in balanced symbiosis. DripDash, along with the rest of the unPhone project,
aims to make aquaponics easier.

DripDash is constructed in three parts:
- The frontend, constructed with Vue.js for control and monitoring.
- The backend, integrating express, the database and GraphQL API.
- The collector, a separate endpoint for communicating WaterElf devices.

DripDash is part of the [unPhone Project](https://unphone.net/).
